# Scripts

Useful scripts that I used along to some tasks that are boring to do hand by hand.

## insert_data.py

    Use case: You can run this when need to populate mongoDB database or collection with
    your inserts. Eg.: Sql inserts, Postgres inserts, etc...

    Before run, you should setup MongoDB connection settings, such as: mongo_uri, database_name and collection_name
